# Truck Sentry
If you are using SAE-J1939 and wondering about next generation firewalls, then this is your stop.

Imagine two attacks, A> Open the door when the vehicle is in motion B> Flood the network

Firewalls in literature cannot stop either, because looking at a single message on the network won't help.
Commercial firewalls may stop B by volume throttling, but not A because in that case they need to maintain information about the vehicle's state of motion. 
Moreover, these firewalls need to be deployed on in-vehicle gateways. Clearly that renders them useless against same segment attacks.

To counter these problems, we introduce TruckSentry -- the next generation centrlized firewall for medium and heavy duty vehicles.
